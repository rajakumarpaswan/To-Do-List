# Vite + React App Setup Guide

This document provides the steps to clone the repository and run the Vite + React app locally on your machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (version 16.8 or later)  
  You can download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

- **Git**  
  Git is required to clone the repository. You can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/).

## Steps to Run the App Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your repository.

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Once the repository is cloned, go into the project directory.

```bash
cd <project-folder>
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

The project uses `npm` (Node Package Manager) to manage dependencies. Run the following command to install all the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install the necessary dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.

### 4. Run the Development Server

After the installation is complete, you can run the development server to start the app locally.

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start the Vite development server. Once it's running, you will see an output with the URL, typically `http://localhost:5173/` or similar.

### 5. Open the App in Your Browser

Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by the development server (usually `http://localhost:5173/`), and you should see the app running.

### 6. Make Changes and See Live Updates

Vite automatically reloads the app in the browser whenever changes are made to the source code. You can edit the files, and the app will reflect the changes without needing to restart the development server.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing dependencies or errors on startup:**  
  If you encounter issues with missing packages or dependencies, try running:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- **Port Conflict:**  
  If the port `5173` is already in use, Vite will try to pick another available port automatically. You can change the port by editing the `vite.config.js` file in the root directory.
